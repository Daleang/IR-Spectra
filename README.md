# IR-Spectra
Code and examples to compute IR spectra from normal mode analysis

IR spectra can be computed based on normal mode analysis from either quantum chemistry or force fields. In this repository we gather information and scripts to compute spectra in the context of the GROMACS (http://www.gromacs.org) simulations software.
